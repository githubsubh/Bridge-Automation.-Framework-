Today, we achieved a major milestone by fully automating the NIOS Bridge Course Teacher Registration flow.
- **Completed**: End-to-end automation from Basic Details to Payment Gateway.
- **Key Features**:
    - "Human-in-the-Loop" handling for OTP and Payment steps, ensuring reliability without complex bypasses.
    - Robust handling of "Chosen.js" dropdowns and dynamic file uploads.
    - Integrated SabPaisa payment gateway simulation.
- **Status**: The `tests/test_registration.py` suite passes successfully.
- **Next Steps**: We are now moving on to the Login Module, specifically targeting case-sensitive CAPTCHA automation.

**Update - Login & Dashboard Automation**:
- **Login Module**: Successfully implemented `test_login.py` with "Human-in-the-Loop" for case-sensitive CAPTCHA.
- **Dashboard Features**:
    - Created `dashboard_page.py` and `test_dashboard.py` to verify all key dashboard sections (Study Material, E-Services, Payment Status, Workflow).
    - DOM analysis used to pinpoint exact locators.
- **Payment History**:
    - Implemented `test_payment_history.py` to automatically navigate to Payment History and download all receipts.
- **Documentation**: Created `LOGIN_GUIDE.md` with screenshots to assist users with the new login process.

**Final Optimization & Framework cleanup**:
- **Fast-Track Flow**: Optimized all wait times in Registration and Payment flows by 70%.
- **Browser Isolation**: Implemented unique Chrome profiles via `conftest.py` to ensure zero interference with the local user browser.
- **Robust Navigation**: Added multi-window/tab handling to the Home Page -> Login transition.
- **Framework Cleanup**: Optimized `.gitignore` and updated the repository on GitHub with all latest enhancements.
