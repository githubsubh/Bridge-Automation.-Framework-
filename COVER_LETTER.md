**RE: Application for QA Automation & Manual Tester Role**

Dear [Hiring Manager Name],

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **QA Automation & Manual Tester** position at **[Company Name]**. With **3 years of hands-on experience** in delivering high-quality software solutions, I specialize in building robust test automation frameworks using **Python and Selenium**, while maintaining a rigorous approach to manual testing for complex workflows.

In my current role working on the **Central and State Education Portal (Ministry of Education)**, I have honed my ability to ensure the stability of critical government platforms serving thousands of users. I successfully led the transition from manual to automated testing, designing a maintainable **Page Object Model (POM)** framework from scratch. This initiative reduced regression testing time by **40%** and significantly improved release cycles.

**Why I am a great fit for [Company Name]:**

*   **Automation Expertise:** I have extensive experience developing scalable automation suites using **Python, Selenium WebDriver, and Pytest**. My frameworks feature dynamic data generation, smart wait mechanisms, and robust handling of complex elements like **Shadow DOM, Payment Gateways (SabPaisa), and dynamic dropdowns**.
*   **Manual Testing Proficiency:** I believe automation complements, not replaces, manual testing. I am skilled in exploratory testing, functional decomposition, and creating detailed test cases that uncover edge-case defects in user registration, secure login flows, and document management systems.
*   **Problem-Solving & Adaptability:** I have engineered unique solutions for "Human-in-the-Loop" scenarios, seamlessly integrating manual checkpoints (like OTP and CAPTCHA) into automated runs to ensure 100% test coverage of security-critical features.
*   **Collaboration:** I am accustomed to working closely with developers and stakeholders, providing detailed defect reports and HTML execution logs to accelerate bug fixing and ensure alignment with business requirements.

I am eager to bring my technical skills and dedication to quality to the team at **[Company Name]**. I am confident that my background in both manual rigor and automation efficiency will allow me to contribute immediately to your software quality goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience aligns with your team's needs.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
